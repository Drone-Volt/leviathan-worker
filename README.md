Mirrored from [leviathan](https://github.com/balena-os/leviathan/), to extract worker functionality into it's own repository. Later this repository can be home to worker plugins.

Currently supported worker plugins:

1. AutoKit (formerly testbot)
2. QemuKit (or balenaVirt)

Refer to the [leviathan docs](https://balena-os.github.io/leviathan) for more information.
